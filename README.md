# Timestamp microservice


> #### Instructions:
> 
> 1.  You can pass a string as a parameter, and the API will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
> 2.  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
> 3.  If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

### Example usage:

`https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/December%2015,%202015`  
`https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/1450137600`

### Example output:

`{ "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }`
